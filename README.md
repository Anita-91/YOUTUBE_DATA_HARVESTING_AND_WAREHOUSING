CAPSTONE_PROJECT_YOUTUBE DATA HARVESTING AND WAREHOUSING.

PROJECT TITLE:
           YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL and Streamlit.
           
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Youtube-Data-Harvesting-And-Warehousing YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project that intends to provide users with the ability to access and analyse data from numerous YouTube channels. SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit are used in the project to develop a user-friendly application that allows users to retrieve, save, and query YouTube channel and video data.
This project aims to develop a user-friendly Streamlit application that utilizes the Google API to extract information on a YouTube channel, stores it in a SQL database, and enables users to search for channel details and join tables to view data in the Streamlit app.

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:
 1. PYTHON -> Python is a powerful programming language renowned for being easy to learn and understand. Python is the primary language employed in this project for the development of the complete application, including data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualisation.
 2. GOOGLE API CLIENT -> Its primary purpose in this project is to interact with YouTube's Data API v3, allowing the retrieval of essential information like channel details, video specifics, and comments. By utilizing googleapiclient, developers can easily access and manipulate YouTube's extensive data resources through code.
 3. MYSQL SERVER 8.0 -> MYSQL is an open-source relational database management system.organizes data into one or more data tables in which data may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language that programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database
 4. STREAMLIT -> Streamlit library is a framework used to build a user-friendly UI web application that enables users to interact with the programme and carry out data retrieval and analysis operations.
 5. PANDAS ->
